hey,
i'm kalkulus




...because math

anyways

i think to program stuff
i'm the pure pursuit programmer for my team, the nerdbots (14353).

in my spare time, you'll probably find me typing, eating food, or doing my gargantuan amounts of homework.

i like rhythm games, primarily robeats, and the best songs on there are 
"I Won't Let You Down (Red Star Macalline remix)(hard)",
"Something in the Water (hard)",
for the last one... tie between "Insight (hard)", "@-@ (hard)", "U Got That (Camellia's Neurofunk Remix)(hard)", and "Heads Will Roll (JVH-C Remix)(hard)"


what else?
i'm learning how to animnate with moon animator and (hopefully) learn lua!

i don't really have anything else to share, then.
bye lol
